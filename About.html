        <p class="aboutpara">I am a born and raised New Jersey native hailing from Elizabeth, NJ. I lived there most of my life until I finished college and took my first job that brought me to Cincinnati, Ohio (pictured above) and eventually Syracuse, NY (pictured below). I graduated from the <a href="//www.njit.edu">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a technical specificiation in Telecommunications. I decided to major in Computer Engineering due to my most profound childhood memory. As a kid, I was always fascinated by the trains used by NJ Transit and the MTA. The start of my interest in engineering comes from waiting for (<em>what is now known as</em>) the D train with my father, and asking him who drives the trains we always see. The answer is of course, <q>An engineer.</q> The title just stuck with me growing up and once I saw I could combine my love for computers into a different discipline of engineering, I decided upon my path. To this day, I always make it a mission to visit a city or town's transit system to snap a photo of the trains they use.</p>
